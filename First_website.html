Letâ€™s learn more and examine the significant difference between AI and human intelligence.</p>
      <h3>Defining AI: Mechanisms and Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is referred to as machine intelligence, and it is rooted in binary codes and mathematical algorithms.<br> It is a testament to human creativity and is capable of massive data processing, pattern recognition, and even self-learning. However, the realm of AI is confined.<br> It lacks the spontaneous creativity, the unpredictable spark of imagination, and the ability to understand context in the way humans can.<br> The vast and structured database of AI is impressive, but it cannot grasp the subtleties of human experiences. The IIM Indore PG Diploma in Management and Artificial Intelligence offers valuable insights and advanced knowledge for those looking to bridge the gap between AI capabilities and human intelligence.
